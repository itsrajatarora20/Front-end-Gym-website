			<p>My name is RAJAT ARORA, and I am the founder of Rajat Fitness Zone. I decided to become a personal trainer having spent years being that person who wanted desperatelt to lose weight and feel good about themselves. I've been on every diet under the sun, and my weight fluctuated massively. Now, having emerged the other side and achieved my goals. I want to use my skills, my experience and my own journey to help others.</p>
			<p>I care about my clients, and there nothing more important to me than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, confident and strong. I know how being overweight affects your whole life, and I want to be there for those who want to bring about change. I want to help you discover the benefits of training that have helped me become the person I am today, and I'm here to guide you every step of the way.</p>
			<p>I understand that life can be hectic and it's often tough to find time to work out.I've been there myself, and I've made every excuse going.Now I've used my experiences to design a program that is managable, enjoyable and proven to work.</p>
			<p>I have been a qualified personal trainer for 5 years now, and in that time, I've worked with more than 100 clients providing a range of fitness training schemes that are tailored to suit clients.</p>
